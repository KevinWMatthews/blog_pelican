...and an introduction to this blog.

## Sanity Check

Where is the code? How can I (actually you) run it?

Most code examples are posted on GitHub along with instructions on how to
compile and run it using CMake/gcc, docker-compose, or Docker.

Here is a [sample project](https://github.com/KevinWMatthews/c-hello_world/)
along with [build documentation](https://kevinwmatthews.github.io/c-hello_world/):

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Welcome and enjoy!
