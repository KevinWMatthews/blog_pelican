Summary: About This Blog

# What is this all about?

This series of posts is about good practices in software development.

The examples are built around design patterns, testing strategies, language
semantics, and third-party libraries.

It is a collection of what I've had occasion to learn, so there is a bias toward
embedded systems.

The goal of each post is to actually do the thing in question, so
code examples are part of working projects. These are available
[on GitHub](https://github.com/KevinWMatthews/).
